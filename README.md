Please read https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists#for-and-in before check over my project. It gives you some point views.
I asked chatgpt to create 10 easy and difficult words for each letter in the English alphabet, and I assigned these words to two files named easyword_list and hardword_list.
According to input from the user, the game begins as Easy or Hard level.
It won't be an easy game either way! :))
Have fun!
